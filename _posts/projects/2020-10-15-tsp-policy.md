Hello guys, this is a small project that I did when I was an unofficial student in my current master's at ufam.
The idea of this game is to solve a simple version of PAC-Man (or the traveling salesman) through Deep Policy Gradients. And at the time I based my work on this [author](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/07/21/skynet-salesman/)

In this [link](https://github.com/ktakanov/SolvingTSPwithPolicyGradients), you can find a presentation file and the code from the time when I was taking the course. Please do not be panic with this code :p.

Nothing more, thank you very much :).

Below there are other results of the algorithm.
