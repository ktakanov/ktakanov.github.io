# Simple image processing with no libraries. (Sharpen, Grayscale, Noise reduction)
  
In this post, we are going to create some processing images tasks in the famous image of Lenna without the traditional OpenCV. The idea here is to understand basic image processing concepts by implementing it.  
  

Firstly, you need to understand that we have several algorithms to create sharpen, grayscale and noise reduction. For noise reduction, we chosen the median filter.  
For sharpening an image, we just made the removal of a blurred image to find the edges. And for grayscale, we showed three types of transformation: luminosity  
the technique, average, and lightness.  
  
  
## Noise reduction with a median filter  
  
Blurring or Noise reduction is used to make an image smooth in which edges are not observed. The main idea of the median filter is to run through the colors, pixel by pixel, replacing each entry with the median of neighboring entries (yes, the same from statistics). The pattern of neighbors is called the "window", which slides, entry by entry, over the entire signal. In our case here, the 'window' will have a square shape.
